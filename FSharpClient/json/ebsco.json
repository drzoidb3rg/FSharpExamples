		"dc.title": "Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators from Omega-3 Fatty Acids Improve Amyloid-ÃŽÂ² Phagocytosis and Regulate Inflammation inÃ‚Â Patients with Minor Cognitive Impairment.",
		"fabio:abstract": "In this review we discuss the immunopathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and recent advances in the prevention of minor cognitive impairment (MCI) by nutritional supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids. Defective phagocytosis of amyloid-ÃŽÂ² (AÃŽÂ²) and abnormal inflammatory activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are the two key immune pathologies of MCI and AD patients. The phagocytosis of AÃŽÂ² by PBMCs of MCI and AD patients is universally defective and the inflammatory gene transcription is heterogeneously deregulated in comparison to normal subjects. Recent studies have discovered a cornucopia of beneficial anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects of the specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) resolvins, protectins, maresins, and their metabolic precursors. Resolvin D1 and other mediators switch macrophages from an inflammatory to a tissue protective/pro-resolving phenotype and increase phagocytosis of AÃŽÂ². In a recent study of AD and MCI patients, nutritional supplementation by omega-3 fatty acids individually increased resolvin D1, improved AÃŽÂ² phagocytosis, and regulated inflammatory genes toward a physiological state, but only in MCI patients. Our studies are beginning to dissect positive factors (adherence to Mediterranean diet with omega-3 and exercise) and negative factors (high fat diet, infections, cancer, and surgeries) in each patient. The in vitro and in vivo effects of omega-3 fatty acids and SPMs suggest that defective phagocytosis and chronic inflammation are related to defective production and/or defective signaling by SPMs in immune cells."

		"dc.title": "The stability of coping strategies in older adults with osteoarthritis and the ability of these strategies to predict changes in depression, disability, and pain.",
		"fabio:abstract": "Objectives:Given the chronically painful, incurable nature of osteoarthritis, effective cognitive and behavioral coping strategies may be critical for older adults with the disease. Little is known about how and why coping changes over time, nor about stability of coping strategies in persons with osteoarthritis. The aims of this work were to examine the structure of coping in older adults with osteoarthritis, the association of coping strategies with well-being, the stability of coping over time, and its association with changes in well-being over the same period. Method:In a cross-sectional study, 199 older adults with osteoarthritis of the knee were assessed at baseline and two-yearsÃ¢Â€Â™ follow-up. Items from two coping scales were factor analyzed, and Pearson's correlations and paired-samplest-tests assessed relative and absolute stability of the resultant coping strategies. CFA assessed the stability of the factor structure itself. Ordinary least-squares regression analyses examined the impact of change in coping on well-being. Results:A five-factor coping solution emerged: stoicism, refocusing, problem-solving, wishful-thinking, and emotion-focused coping. The factor structure showed stability over the two-year period. Absolute stability of strategies varied, indicating that change in coping styles was possible. Conclusion:Changes in coping style predicts future well-being; however, coping remains malleable with age and maladaptive strategies can be effectively targeted. Greater knowledge of the utility or maladaptive nature of a given strategy may help guide decisions about interventions for patients with osteoarthritis and encourage more adaptive coping styles."

		"fabio:abstract": "Deferasirox is a novel once-daily, oral iron chelator. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and tolerability of deferasirox in Taiwanese patients with transfusion-dependent ÃŽÂ²-thalassemia who have been treated with deferasirox for 7Ã‚Â years. Taiwanese patients aged Ã¢Â‰Â¥2Ã‚Â years with transfusion-dependent ÃŽÂ²-thalassemia whose serum ferritin levels were Ã¢Â‰Â¥1000Ã‚Â ng/mL and had started deferasirox treatment since December 2005 at the National Taiwan University Hospital were enrolled. Sixty patients were recruited for analysis, and 11 (18.3Ã‚Â %) patients discontinued deferasirox during the study. In the 42 patients included in the efficacy analysis, the mean serum ferritin levels decreased significantly by 2566Ã‚Â ng/mL after 7Ã‚Â years of treatment (PÃ¢Â€Â‰<Ã¢Â€Â‰0.001). Forty-one of these patients received a cardiac T2* evaluation after 3Ã‚Â years of deferasirox treatment, and the mean cardiac T2* value increased significantly from 30.6Ã¢Â€Â‰Ã‚Â±Ã¢Â€Â‰16.6 to 45.9Ã¢Â€Â‰Ã‚Â±Ã¢Â€Â‰22.6Ã‚Â ms after 7Ã‚Â years of deferasirox treatment (PÃ¢Â€Â‰<Ã¢Â€Â‰0.001). Deferasirox-related adverse events assessed by investigators were reported in 46 (76.7Ã‚Â %) patients. The most common adverse events related to deferasirox were skin rashes (nÃ¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰29, 48.3Ã‚Â %), followed by abdominal pain (nÃ¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰23, 38.3Ã‚Â %) and diarrhea (nÃ¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰16, 26.7Ã‚Â %). Most adverse events were manageable. This study demonstrated that long-term treatment with deferasirox was effective in improving iron overload, including cardiac iron overload, in patients with transfusion-dependent ÃŽÂ²-thalassemia. Deferasirox was well tolerated; however, the incidences of common adverse events related to deferasirox appeared higher in our Taiwanese patients than other studies."

		"dc.title": "Impact of olfactory and auditory priming on the attraction to foods with high energy density.",
		"fabio:abstract": "Recent research suggests that non-attentively perceived stimuli may significantly influence consumers' food choices. The main objective of the present study was to determine whether an olfactory prime (a sweet-fatty odour) and a semantic auditory prime (a nutritional prevention message), both presented incidentally, either alone or in combination can influence subsequent food choices. The experiment included 147 participants who were assigned to four different conditions: a control condition, a scented condition, an auditory condition or an auditory-scented condition. All participants remained in the waiting room during15Ã‚Â min while they performed a 'lure' task. For the scented condition, the participants were unobtrusively exposed to a 'pain au chocolat' odour. Those in the auditory condition were exposed to an audiotape including radio podcasts and a nutritional message. A third group of participants was exposed to both olfactory and auditory stimuli simultaneously. In the control condition, no stimulation was given. Following this waiting period, all participants moved into a non-odorised test room where they were asked to choose, from dishes served buffet-style, the starter, main course and dessert that they would actually eat for lunch. The results showed that the participants primed with the odour of 'pain au chocolat' tended to choose more desserts with high energy density (i.e., a waffle) than the participants in the control condition (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.06). Unexpectedly, the participants primed with the nutritional auditory message chose to consume more desserts with high energy density than the participants in the control condition (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.03). In the last condition (odour and nutritional message), they chose to consume more desserts with high energy density than the participants in the control condition (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.01), and the data reveal an additive effect of the two primes."

		"fabio:abstract": "Primary malignant tumors of the lacrimal passage, particularly of the nasolacrimal duct, are rare. We describe a 72-year-old woman who presented with lacrimation 5 years previously. She had pain and bloody and purulent lacrimation, and a mass was identified in the inferior meatus. Accordingly, she was diagnosed with primary adenoid cystic carcinoma of the nasolacrimal duct. She was treated with proton beam therapy and showed a favorable response. Owing to the long-term risks of recurrence and distant metastasis, adenoid cystic carcinoma requires sufficient follow-up."

		"dc.title": "Androgen receptor inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration, and invasion of PC-3 prostate cancer cells.",
		"fabio:abstract": "Bone metastasis is very common in prostate cancer (PCa) and causes severe pain. PC-3 is an androgen receptor (AR)-negative PCa cell line with high metastatic potential established from PCa bone metastasis. We observed that re-expression of AR, which is located in the cytoplasm in the absence of androgen, suppressed cell motility, migration, and invasion of PC-3 cells as determined by wound healing assay and transwell assay. Micro-Western Array and Western blotting analysis indicated that re-expression of AR increased APC, Akt2, Akt3, PI3K p85, phospho-PI3K p85 Tyr458, PI3K p85, and E-cadherin but decreased GSK-3ÃŽÂ², phospho-GSK-3ÃŽÂ² Ser9, phospho-mTOR Ser2448, Skp2, NF-ÃŽÂºB p50, Slug, N-cadherin, ÃŽÂ²-catenin, vimentin, MMP-9, and Snail. Migration and invasion of PC-3 and PC-3(AR) cells were promoted by EGF or IGF-1 but were suppressed by Casodex. Re-expression of AR reduced the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in PC-3 cells. Our observations suggested that re-expressing AR suppresses migration and invasion of PC-3 cells via regulation of EMT marker proteins and MMP activity."

		"dc.title": "A pilot study Ã¢Â€Â“ the potential value of an activity-based feedback system for treatment of individuals with chronic lower back pain.",
		"fabio:abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the potential value of a new personalized activity-based feedback treatment.Method: A prognostic cohort study was carried out in the daily environment of the patients. Seventeen individuals with chronic lower back pain (CLBP) symptoms for >3 months were included. Patients were from the Netherlands, aged 18Ã¢Â€Â“65 years. Patients wore an accelerometer and a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) for 15Ã¢Â€Â‰d. Patients received continuous and time-related personalized feedback and were instructed to follow the activity pattern as displayed on the PDA. Technical performance and compliance with the system were rated. Objective and subjective activity scores were compared for exploring awareness. The absolute difference between the activity pattern of the patient and the norm value used was calculated and expressed as mean difference. Pain intensity was measured using the VAS.Results: The technical performance and compliance with the system were rated moderate. More than half of the patients were aware of their activity level during the feedback days (67%). A positive effect of the feedback was seen in a trend which showed a decrease in the absolute difference between the activity pattern of the patient and the norm value (pÃ¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰0.149) and a significant decrease in pain intensity levels (pÃ¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰0.005).Conclusions: This pilot study suggested that an individual-tailored feedback system that focuses on the activity behavior of the patient has potential as the treatment of individuals with CLBP.Implications for RehabilitationActivity-based feedback for individuals with chronic low back pain:Many patients are not aware of their activity patterns.The activity patterns of patients differ from those of healthy controls.It is important to make patients aware of their activity patterns in order to change activity behavior.An individual-tailored feedback system seems promising in decreasing pain intensity levels for a subgroup of patients."

		"dc.title": "Physical functioning of low back pain patients: perceived physical functioning and functional capacity, but not physical activity is affected.",
		"fabio:abstract": "Purpose: Physical functioning is a multidimensional construct covering perceived functioning, functional capacity and actual physical activity. Currently, the assessment of physical functioning in low back pain (LBP) patients has been limited to only one or two of these aspects. This study evaluates physical functioning of LBP patients by assessing the three individual aspects using questionnaires and ambulant sensor-based measurements.Methods: Actual physical activity, functional capacity and perceived functioning were measured in 26 patients undergoing patient specific treatment before, direct and 3Ã¢Â€Â“4 weeks after the first treatment using, respectively, sensor-based activity monitoring, sensor-based motion analysis test and the Oswestry questionnaire. Patients were compared to a healthy control group.Results: Perceived functioning and functional capacity, but not actual physical activity is impaired in pre-treatment LBP patients. After treatment, patients improved in perceived physical functioning and functional capacity approaching healthy levels, however only slight (pÃ¢Â€Â‰>Ã¢Â€Â‰0.05) improvements in actual physical activity were found. Moreover, only few and weak correlations were found between the different aspects of physical functioning.Conclusion: Perceived functioning, actual physical activity and functional capacity are three independent outcome dimensions, being complementary but not redundant. Especially, perceived functioning and physical capacity need attention when evaluating LBP patients during rehabilitation.Implications for RehabilitationPerceived physical functioning and physical capacity are negatively affected by low back pain and improve after treatment.Low back pain patients perform their daily activity independent of pain and complaints.Inertia sensor-based motion analysis can objectify treatment effects showing low back pain patients their progress in rehabilitation.New interventions can be justified with inertia sensor technology in low back pain patients."

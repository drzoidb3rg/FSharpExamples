The purposes of this study were to examine different cancer beliefs and disparities in cancer beliefs across groups of individuals with distinct cancer histories and to identify whether cancer history predicts a set of cancer beliefs. Methods: Using Leventhalâ€™s Common Sense Model and data from the 2007 Health Information National Trends Survey (N = 7,172), we constructed multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the effect of different stimuli, including cancer experience on cancer perceptions (e.g., prevention, causation, outcome, worry). Results: Findings indicated significant associations between cancer history and cancer perceptions. Individuals with family and personal cancer histories were more likely than individuals without any cancer history to worry about getting cancer (OR = 3.55, 95 %CI = 2.53âˆ’4.99), agree they will develop cancer in the future (OR = 8.81, 95%CI = 6.12âˆ’12.67) and disagree that cancer is most often caused by a personâ€™s behavior or lifestyle (OR = 1.24, 95 %CI = 1.01âˆ’1.52). Conclusions: Cancer history affects perceptions throughout the cancer continuum. Additionally, cancer history may influence coping behaviors and outcomes. Cancer education and survivorship programs should assess important variables such as cancer history to more effectively tailor services and monitor evolving needs throughout cancer care. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Integrating cancer history information into patient education programs tailored to an individualâ€™s needs may better empower survivors and their family members to effectively promote informed decision-making about screening and preventive health behaviors, manage cancer worry, and enhance quality of life.

		"fabio:abstract": "<subfield code=\"a\" xmlns=\"http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim\">Objectives: Identity labels with which people diagnosed with cancer identify may have important implications for postâ€cancer adjustment, yet little is known about these identities, and virtually nothing about them in people diagnosed during late adolescence and young adulthood (LAYA). We examined (1) the extent to which LAYA participants endorse different identities, (2) relations between identities and subsequent adjustment (positive/negative impact of cancer, quality of life, health behaviours), and (3) coping as mediating identityâ€“adjustment links. Design: A longitudinal study in which 120 participants at Time 1 (T1) and 84 participants at Time 2 (T2; 1 year later) were assessed. Methods: Participants had been diagnosed between ages 15 and 39. Demographics, cancerâ€related variables, adjustment, and identities (victim/patient/someone who has had cancer/survivor/conqueror/member of the cancer community) were measured. Results: Late adolescence and young adulthoods with cancer identify with a variety of terms. At both time points, someone who has had cancer was the most highly endorsed identity. Survivor and member of the cancer community were also frequently chosen. Generally, T1 survivor, conqueror, and member of the cancer community identities were positively correlated with T2 adjustment, whereas victim and patient identities were negatively correlated with T2 adjustment. Both T1 member of the cancer community identity and T2 emotional expression coping independently and positively predicted T2 positive selfâ€evaluation even when T1 positive selfâ€evaluation was controlled. Conclusions Forming empowering identities (e.g., survivor) and emphasizing community identity (member of the cancer community) appear helpful to postâ€cancer adjustment. Future studies need to examine cancerâ€related identities and mechanisms explaining identityâ€“adjustment links in this understudied group.

Design: Systematic review and matched retrospective cohort study. Setting: Australia. Participants: Systematic review: published papers that included a comparison of cancer stage at diagnosis, treatment uptake, mortality and/or survival for Indigenous people across remoteness categories were identified (n = 181). Fifteen papers (13 studies) were included in the review. Original analyses: new analyses were conducted using data from the Queensland Indigenous Cancer Study (QICS) comparing cancer stage at diagnosis, treatment uptake, and survival for Indigenous cancer patients living in rural/remote areas (n = 627, 66%) and urban areas (n = 329, 34%). Main Outcome Measures: Systematic review: Papers were included if there were related to stage of disease at diagnosis, treatment, mortality and survival of cancer. Restrictions were not placed on the outcome measures reported (e.g. standardised mortality ratios versus crude mortality rates). Original analyses: Odds ratios (OR, 95%CI) were used to compare stage of disease and treatment uptake between the two remoteness groups. Treatment uptake (treated/not treated) was analysed using logistic regression analysis. Survival was analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression. The final multivariate models included stage of cancer at diagnosis and areaâ€level socioeconomic status (SEIFA). Results: Existing evidence of variation in cancer outcomes for Indigenous people in remote compared with metropolitan areas is limited. While no previous studies have reported on differences in cancer stage and treatment uptake by remoteness within the Indigenous population, the available evidence suggests Indigenous cancer patients are less likely to survive their cancer the further they live from urban centres. New analysis of QICS data indicates that Indigenous cancer patients in rural/remote Queensland were less likely to be diagnosed with localised disease and less likely to receive treatment for their cancer compared to their urban counterparts. Conclusion: More research is needed to fully understand geographic differentials in cancer outcomes within the Indigenous population. Knowing how geographical location interacts with Indigenous status can help to identify ways of improving cancer outcomes for Indigenous Australians.

		"fabio:abstract": "<subfield code=\"a\" xmlns=\"http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim\">Abstract Objective Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) diagnosed with cancer between 15 and 39 years of age often report need for greater amounts of cancerâ€related information and perceive that cancer has had a negative impact on control over their life. We examined whether unmet information need and perceived control over life are associated with healthâ€related quality of life (HRQOL). Methods We examined data from 484 AYA cancer survivors recruited from populationâ€based cancer registries in 2007â€“2008. Participants completed surveys a median of 11 months after diagnosis. Multivariable linear regression analyses estimated associations of unmet cancerâ€related information needs and impact of cancer on control over life on HRQOL (SFâ€12). Results Twoâ€thirds of AYAs reported an intermediate or high level of unmet information need, and half (47%) reported a negative impact of cancer on control. Greater unmet information need was associated with lower overall mental and physical HRQOL and lower levels of all HRQOL subscales except vitality. A negative impact on control over life was associated with lower overall mental HRQOL as well as lower HRQOL across all subscales except general health perceptions (all p &lt;0.05). In multivariable analyses, perceived control and unmet information need were independently associated with HRQOL (pâ€values for interaction &gt;0.1). Conclusions Adolescent and young adult patients with cancer have high levels of unmet cancerâ€related information needs and perceived negative impact of cancer on control over life; both were independently associated with lower HRQOL. Addressing unmet information needs among AYA cancer survivors and finding ways to increase their sense of control may help improve HRQOL in this understudied population.

		"fabio:abstract": "<subfield code=\"a\" xmlns=\"http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim\">Over the past three decades various definitions of cancer survivor and cancer survivorship have been proposed. These definitions frequently describe (1) who is considered a cancer survivor and who is experiencing cancer survivorship, (2) what it means to a be survivor and experience survivorship, and (3) when someone is considered a survivor and when survivorship begins. Descriptive epidemiology indicates that certain individuals diagnosed and treated for cancer describe the presence of specific unmet needs following diagnosis and treatment for cancer. Evidence also points to an increased likelihood of cancer recurrence or a new cancer in many cancer patients. These observations should be reflected in the case definitions of cancer survivor and cancer survivorship. This paper reviews the literature for evidence to validate existing definitions of cancer survivor and cancer survivorship and proposes updated definitions for each. Based on this evidence, a cancer survivor is defined as an individual diagnosed with cancer. The period following primary treatment, which is characterized by transitions in care and a need to address the late effects of cancer and its treatment, may be a particularly critical time for the cancer survivor. The definition does not preclude the major involvement of family, friends, caregivers, and providers, but does place the focus on the individual who received the diagnosis of cancer. Children and young adult cancer survivors should be housed in subgroups under the \"cancer survivor\" umbrella. In addition, cancer survivorship is defined as the period of time beginning at cancer diagnosis where attention by the survivor and his or her care team is directed at addressing needs related to health, symptoms, function, lifestyle, and well-being; these needs may change through the care trajectory. Coordination of care between oncologist specialists involved in the early phases of cancer diagnosis and treatment and primary care physicians involved in long-term follow-up is critical. As new knowledge is acquired regarding cancer survival and the cancer experience, modifications to these proposed definitions will be imperative.

		"fabio:abstract": "<subfield code=\"a\" xmlns=\"http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim\">Prostate cancer is the second most common malignancy diagnosed in men, after nonmelanoma skin cancer An estimated 238,590 new cases of prostate cancer occur per year It is the second most common cause of cancer death, after lung cancer. Prostate cancer is a disease of age. One in six men will develop prostate cancer, with the risk of invasive prostate cancer rising in each successive decade of life (Siegel et al. 2013). Additionally, roughly half of men have occult prostate cancer at the time of their death (Delongchamps et al. 2006). Despite its large prevalence, the annual death rate from prostate cancer is low (Mohler et al. 2013). Men with prostate cancer confined to the organ at diagnosis can expect a nearly 100% rate survival at 5 years, whereas those with distant metastases have only a 29.3% survival rate (Howlader et aL 2013). Excluding age, risk factors for prostate cancer include African American ethnicity (Platz et al. 2000); family history (Bruner et al. 2003); BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (Risch et al. 2006; Thompson and Easton 2002); Lynch syndrome (Raymond et al. 2013); and, to a lesser extent, diet (Chan et al. 2005), insulin resistance (Albanes et al. 2009), and obesity (Stewart and Freedland 2011). Perhaps of particular importance to psychiatric care is the increased risk of prostate cancer in veterans exposed to Agent Orange (Chamie et al. 2008). Because mortality is higher among individuals with psychiatric illness, incidence estimates of prostate cancer in this population have skewed toward younger patients. However, one large retrospective study suggested that the incidence of prostate cancer is lower in patients with schizophrenia. This may be due to the relatively low percentage of older patients with schizophrenia (Lin et al. 2013). Other data show no significant difference between psychiatric patients and control subjects but suggest a similar trend (Hippisley-Cox et al. 2007). A high cumulative dose of phenothiazine may be protective against prostate cancer (Mortensen 1992). Patients who receive a diagnosis of prostate cancer are vulnerable to developing psychiatric conditions. Clinicians are advised to keep this in mind as their patients proceed through workup and treatment. One study found that up to 4.3% of patients with prostate cancer develop posttraumatic stress disorder (Mehnert et al. 2010). All patients with a diagnosis of prostate cancer should be referred to a specialist for ongoing management. However, it behooves psychiatrists and other primary care providers to be aware of the basics of treatment guidelines so they may provide timely input.

		"fabio:abstract": "<subfield code=\"a\" xmlns=\"http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim\">Approximately one in seven men in the United States will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetimes. The disease is the most frequently diagnosed type of male cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death for men. In 2013, there were an estimated 238,590 new cases of prostate cancer and 29,720 deaths from the disease in the United States. Prostate cancer is rarely diagnosed among men less than 40 years of age, but risk for the disease increases, especially beginning at age 50. Almost two-thirds of prostate cancer cases are diagnosed in men who are 65 years of age or older. Risk for being diagnosed with and dying from prostate cancer is especially high among African Americans as compared to whites. Studies to date have not completely determined the reasons for this ethnic disparity, but it is likely that the explanation is multifactorial. There are also increased risks associated with having a family history of prostate cancer. Hereditary risk for prostate cancer has been defined as having three or more first-degree relatives (father, brother, son), three successive generations of either the maternal or paternal lineages, or at least two relatives affected at or before age 55 years.\" A single first-degree relative with prostate cancer carries a twofold higher risk of developing prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is most often detected using the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test and/or digital rectal examination (DRE). Although other procedures have been advocated for use in screening (e.g., PSA velocity, PSA density, age-specific PSA range, and free PSA), the combined use of PSA testing and DRE is the most common screening strategy. The overwhelming majority of newly diagnosed prostate cancer cases are found at an early stage, largely due to increased prostate cancer screening in primary care. Survival following treatment is high, with rates for localized prostate cancer approaching 100%. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)</subfield>"

		"fabio:abstract": "<subfield code=\"a\" xmlns=\"http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim\">Background: Twitter is an interactive, real-time media that could prove useful in health care. Tweets from cancer patients could offer insight into the needs of cancer patients. Objective: The objective of this study was to understand cancer patientsâ€™ social media usage and gain insight into patient needs. Methods: A search was conducted of every publicly available user profile on Twitter in Japan for references to the following: breast cancer, leukemia, colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, uterine cancer, cervical cancer, stomach cancer, lung cancer, and ovarian cancer. We then used an application programming interface and a data mining method to conduct a detailed analysis of the tweets from cancer patients. Results: Twitter user profiles included references to breast cancer (n = 313), leukemia (n = 158), uterine or cervical cancer (n = 134), lung cancer (n = 87), colon cancer (n = 64), and stomach cancer (n = 44). A co-occurrence network is seen for all of these cancers, and each cancer has a unique network conformation. Keywords included words about diagnosis, symptoms, and treatments for almost all cancers. Words related to social activities were extracted for breast cancer. Words related to vaccination and support from public insurance were extracted for uterine or cervical cancer. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that cancer patients share information about their underlying disease, including diagnosis, symptoms, and treatments, via Twitter. This information could prove useful to health care providers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)</subfield>"

		"fabio:abstract": "<subfield code=\"a\" xmlns=\"http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim\">Background: Life-threatening diseases, such as head and neck cancer (HNCa), can stimulate the emergence of a new disease-specific self-concept. We hypothesized that (i) negative cancer-stereotypes invoke distancing, which inhibits the adoption of a disease-specific self-concept and (ii) patient characteristics, disease and treatment factors, and cancer-related stressors moderate the phenomenon. Methods: Head and neck cancer outpatients (N = 522) completed a semantic-differential measure of disease-specific self-concept (perceived similarity to the â€˜cancer patientâ€™) and other self-report measures in structured interviews. Negative cancer-stereotypes were represented by the number of semantic-differential dimensions (0â€“3) along which respondents evaluated the stereotypic â€˜cancer patientâ€™ negatively (i.e., negative valence). We tested the two-way interactions between negative valence and hypothesized moderator variables. Results: We observed significant negative valence moderator interactions for the following: (i) patient characteristics (education, employment, social networks); (ii) disease and treatment factors (cancer-symptom burden); and (iii) cancer-related stressors (uncertainty, lack of information, and existential threats). Negative cancer stereotypes were consistently associated with distancing of self from the stereotypic â€˜cancer patient,â€™ but the effect varied across moderator variables. All significant moderators (except employment and social networks) were associated with increasing perceived similarity to the â€˜cancer patientâ€™ when respondents maintained negative stereotypes; perceived similarity decreased when people were employed or had extensive social networks. Moderator effects were less pronounced when respondents did not endorse negative cancer stereotypes. Discussion: When they hold negative stereotypes, people with HNCa distance themselves from a â€˜cancer patientâ€™ identity to preserve self-esteem or social status, but exposure to cancer-related stressors and adaptive demands may attenuate these effects.
